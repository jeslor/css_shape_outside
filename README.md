# CSS Shape-Outside Techniques ðŸŒŸ

This project demonstrates the use of the `shape-outside` CSS property to create dynamic and visually engaging layouts where text wraps around non-rectangular shapes like circles, polygons, and images.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Circular Shapes**: Wrap text around circular elements using `shape-outside: circle()`. 
- **Polygon Shapes**: Define custom shapes (triangles, hexagons, etc.) with `shape-outside: polygon()`.
- **Image Contours**: Let text flow around irregular images using `shape-outside: url()`.
